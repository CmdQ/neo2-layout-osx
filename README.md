# neo2-layout-osx
Neo2 keyboard layout file for macOS.

This is based on the file provided by [neo-layout.org](http://neo-layout.org/),
but has a number of improvements:

* Improved caps lock layout: Top row still provides the numbers (special symbols
  require shift in addition to caps lock), letters are switched to lowercase
  when shift is pressed, allow to type layer 3 symbols with mod 3 when caps lock
  is active.
* Fixes to the handling of M3+Cmd to increase compatibility with shortcuts
  (though, shortcuts involving M3 can still be problematic and will remain so
  for the foreseeable future).
* A few unassigned keys in the layout have been fixed.
* Fixed layer 4 minus.
* Fixed the layout of the Ctrl modifier to work in MacVim.
* Fixed compose function for Ã±.
* Fixed Ctrl+J.
* Alternative icons that can be used with the new dark mode in macOS Mojave.
